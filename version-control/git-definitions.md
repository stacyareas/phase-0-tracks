# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is where you can see a timeline of changes that have been made to one or more files and merge changes from those files. This is useful because it allows to see if anything needs to be updated if the code somehow isn't working correctly. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a file you are working and you would use branching is you are working on a project with multiple people so that everything stays seprate until it is ready to be merge to the master file. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for git which allows you to leave a short detail message of any new changes you have made to a file. Anything that is easy to understand and right to the point would be a good commit message. 

* What is a merge conflict?

This is when a separate branches make close to the same changes within the same file.
