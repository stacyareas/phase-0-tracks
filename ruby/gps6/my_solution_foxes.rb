# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Paulizleet].
# We spent [1] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#
# Makes the ruby script import another script or class from a directory.
require_relative 'state_data'

class VirusPredictor

  # Method: initialize
  # Input: String for state, string for pop. density, and integer for population
  # Output: None
  # Description: Initialize a new instance of the VirusPredictor class
  #   taking into account the state to be tracked, and its population.

  # Input: None
  # Output: Output of methods predicted_deaths and speed_of_spread
  #

  # Input: Instance attributes of the class itself.
  # Output: String 
  # Description: Run some figures for how lethal an infection will be

    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.
