<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? 

The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are elements with meaning, clearly defining the content within. One I find most useful would be <header> which list most important to least important information. <section> which defines each selection and it's content within a web page. <article> which is almost like <section> but an article isn't necessarily connected with anything else. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

<!DOCTYPE html> doc type
<html> web page
<head><title></title></head> title that isn't visable to the user but shows what the page is about in the tab
<body> info. thats related to the page
<h1></h1> most important header
<p></p> paragraph
</body>
</html>

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I learned that if you use certains that you can create a snippet it to call on it whenever you need. I definitely think I'll be using it in the furture when I become more comfortable with sublime. For now I will stick to typing things out until I full understand. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

For me it was a great struggle to get the meaning of the tags I was using and remembering what was what. This challenge help me brush up oh things I forgot about. I've been trying my best to go over the infomation that was give in html and also my own research. It help me to practice after I have read over certian tags.
